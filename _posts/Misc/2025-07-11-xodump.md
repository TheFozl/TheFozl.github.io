## Dumping a Non-Readable ELF Binary with xodump

Sometimes, especially in CTFs or hardened environments, you get an ELF binary that is executable but not readable:

```bash
sonic@pc:~$ ls -lsah crackme
16K -rwx--x--x 1 root root 16K Jul 11 18:11 crackme
````

When executed:

```bash
sonic@pc:~$ ./crackme
Enter password: eggman
Wrong password!
```

You cannot open it, copy it, or run any static analysis directly.

Solution: use [xodump](https://github.com/StroppaFR/xodump).

## Method

1. **Compile xodump** (on the target if you have a compiler, otherwise compile elsewhere and upload):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StroppaFR/xodump.git
   cd xodump
   make
   ```

2. **Dump the memory-mapped binary:**

   ```bash
   ./xodump crackme > out
   will try to dump mapped executable /home/sonic/crackme
   dumping memory mapping from 0x555555554000 to 0x555555555000
   ...
   successfully dumped 0x5000 bytes from mapped executable /home/sonic/crackme
   child process exited correctly after dump
   ```

3. **Analyze the dump:**

   ```bash
   strings out
   ```

   Immediately you get the password string used in the binary:

   ```
   Enter password:
   GottaGoFast
   Good password!
   Wrong password!
   ```

Of course, in real use, you'll load `out` into IDA or Ghidra, and the binaries won't be a simple crackme.

## Notes

* This only works if you can execute the binary. If you do not trust the binary, do not run it.
* Works even with setuid binaries.
* All credits to [nikost](https://github.com/StroppaFR) for xodump, which improves on the old [XOcopy](http://reverse.lostrealm.com/tools/xocopy.html).

## Example crackme used:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char password[20];
    printf("Enter password: ");
    fgets(password, 20, stdin);
    if (strcmp(password, "GottaGoFast\n") == 0) {
        printf("Good password!\n");
    } else {
        printf("Wrong password!\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

## TL;DR

* If you can execute an ELF binary, you can dump it from memory with xodump, even if it is not readable.
* Useful for CTF, pentest, any situation with “execute-only” binaries.
